        I'm Ngozi Favour Nwhachukwu, a passionate and versatile creative
        professional with a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
        Over the years, I’ve expanded my skill set beyond engineering into the
        digital space as a Software Developer, Graphic Designer, and Video Editor.
        I love building functional, user-focused applications and digital
        experiences that make an impact. Whether it's coding intuitive web
        applications, designing visually compelling graphics, or editing engaging
        videos, I’m driven by creativity and problem-solving.
